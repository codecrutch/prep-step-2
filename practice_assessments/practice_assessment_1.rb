# An isogram is a word of only non-repeating letters. Define a method that, given two isograms of the same length, returns an array of two elements indicating matches: the first number is the number of letters matched in both words at the same position, and the second is the number of letters matched in both words but not in the same position.

# You have a panoramic view in front of you, but you only can take a picture of two landmarks at a time (your camera is small). You want to capture every pair of landmarks that are next to each other. Define a method that, given an array of landmarks, returns an array of every adjacent pair from left to right. Assume the panorama wraps around.

# Xbonacci

# Define a Xbonacci method that works similarly to the fibonacci sequence.
# The fibonacci sequence takes the previous two numbers in the sequence and adds
# them together to create the next number.
#
# First five fibonacci numbers = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
# The fourth fibonacci number (3) is the sum of the two numbers before it
# (1 and 2).
#
# In Xbonacci, the sum of the previous X numbers (instead of the previous 2 numbers)
# of the sequence becomes the next number in the sequence.
#
# The method will take two arguments: the starting sequence with X number of
# elements and an integer N. The method will return the first N elements in the given
# sequence.
#
# xbonacci([1, 1], 5) => [1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
# xbonacci([1, 1, 1, 1], 8) => [1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 7, 13, 25]
#
# X is the length of the starting sequence.
#
# number_of_xbonacci_numbers_to_return is the same as N.
