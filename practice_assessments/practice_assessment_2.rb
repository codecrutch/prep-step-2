# An abundant number is less than the sum of its divisors, not including itself. 12's divisors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, which sum to 16. xw16 > 12 so 12 is an abundant number.

# Write a method that, given a sentence without punctuation or capitalization, returns the word with the greatest number of repeated letters. Return the first word if there's a tie. It doesn't matter how often individual letters repeat, just that they repeat.
