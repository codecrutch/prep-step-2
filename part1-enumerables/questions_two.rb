# Define a method that returns the sum of all the elements in its argument (an array of numbers).

# Define a method that returns a boolean indicating whether substring is a substring of all the long_strings (an array).
def in_all_strings?(long_strings, substring)

# Define a method that accepts a string of lower case words (no punctuation) and returns an array of letters that occur more than once.

# Define a method that returns an array of the longest two words (in order) in the method's argument. Ignore punctuation!

# MEDIUM

# Define a method that returns an array of letters that do not occur in the method's argument.

# HARD

# Given a an array of songs at the top of the charts, return the songs that only stayed on the chart for a week at a time. Each element corresponds to a song at the top of the charts for one particular week.
# Songs CAN reappear on the chart, but if they don't appear in consecutive weeks, they're "one-week wonders."
# Suggested strategy: find the songs that appear multiple times in a row and remove them.
# You may wish to write a helper method no_repeats?
def one_week_wonders(songs)

end

def no_repeats?(song_name, songs)

end


# Given a string of words, return the word that has the letter "c" closest to the end of it. If there's a tie, return the earlier word. Ignore punctuation. If there's no "c", return an empty string. You may wish to write the helper methods c_distance and remove_punctuation.
