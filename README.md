Hey folks,

Welcome to App Academy's Prep Step 2.

Before you begin this step, you should have completed our Step 1
[curriculum][step1] and passed our Step 1 assessment.

During this step, we'll learn about a couple new data structures, like ranges
and hashes, and we'll delve deeper into iterators and enumerables. All these
tools should help us write cleaner, shorter code and solve some harder coding
problems.

Once you've finished the curriculum for Prep Step 2, you'll want to take our
Step 2 assessment. This assessment is done online with a TA from App Academy via
a Skype conversation. We've given you four practice assessments to prepare
before you take this assessment.

Good luck, future developers!
