Hey everyone,

Great work completing App Academy's Prep Step 2. You should be proud of
everything you've accomplished and everything you've learned so far.

The final technical step in our application process is for you to complete a
technical interview over Skype. You should check your inbox for an email with
instructions describing how to sign up for the assessment.

Assessment Two will be one hour long, and you'll be expected to solve coding
problems similar in difficulty to those in the practice assessments we've
provided. You should study those practice assessments in preparation, and don't
forget to look at the solutions.

Good luck, developers! I look forward to working with you at App Academy.
