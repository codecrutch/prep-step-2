# Glossary

* Hash - A collection of key-value pairs with unique keys.
* Hash Rocket - An operator for mapping keys to values in a hash: `=>`.

## Hash Methods
* `has_key?(key)` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a key in the hash.
* `has_value?(val)` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a value in the hash.
* `include?(key)` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a key in the hash.
* `keys` - Returns an array of all the keys in its receiver.
* `key?(key)` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a key in the hash.
* `length` - Returns the number of key-value pairs in its receiver.
* `to_a` - Type converts its receiver hash into a nested array of [_key_, _value_] arrays.
* `to_h` - Type converts a nested array of two-element arrays to a hash.
* `values` - Returns an array of all the values in its receiver.
* `value?(val)` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a value in the hash.
