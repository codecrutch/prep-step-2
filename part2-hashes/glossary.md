## Hash Methods
* `has_key?` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a key in the hash.
* `has_value?` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a value in the hash.
* `include?` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a key in the hash.
* `keys` - Returns an array of all the keys in its receiver.
* `key?` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a key in the hash.
* `length` - Returns the number of key-value pairs in its receiver.
* `to_a` - Type converts its receiver hash into a nested array of [_key_, _value_] arrays.
* `to_h` - Type converts a nested array of two-element arrays to a hash.
* `values` - Returns an array of all the values in its receiver.
* `value?` - Returns a boolean indicating whether its argument is a value in the hash.
